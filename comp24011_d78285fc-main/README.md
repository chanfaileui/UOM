# COMP24011 2024 Labs

This is the repo for COMP24011 labs in the academic session 2024-25.

There is a separate branch for each of the 4 lab assignments of the course.
These are called: `lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`, `lab4`.
To access the materials for each lab you need to switch to the corresponding branch.
For example, you can use the command
```
git checkout lab1
```

Every branch has a Unix shell refresh script to fetch lab materials when they become available.
You **need to** run this shell script before you start working on the assignment.
This can be done with the command
```
./refresh.sh
```

There are generic instructions on coursework submission via GitLab in Appendix L of the [CS UG Handbook](https://online.manchester.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-16350838-dt-content-rid-185496744_1/xid-185496744_1).
There are also submission guidelines for the course on Blackboard in the [Laboratory Exercises](https://online.manchester.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_15828703_1&course_id=_81433_1) page.
You **must** follow these instructions and use the **correct git tag** given the manual for each lab to successfully submit your assignments.

Please ask for support in the lab sessions if you're unsure about any lab instructions or submission.
